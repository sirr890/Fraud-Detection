# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Anomaly detection is used to identify rare events, items, and observations suspicious of average or non-anomalous behavior or pattern. Such an approach has been developed for sevehis problem will be solved such that given x, the model will predict 1, corresponding to an anomaly or 0 to a normal example. In this case, three differents approches are used https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html

My approach to solve this problem will be as follows. Given x, the model will predict 1, corresponding to an anomaly or 0 to a normal example. Then, I used three differents approches https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html

**Isolation Forest**
  The Isolation Forest is an anomaly detection algorithm that identifies anomalies instead of profiling normal data points.
  
**Gaussian Mixture Models**
  A Gaussian Mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters.
  
**One Class SVM**
  The One Class SVM is an unsupervised algorithm that learns a decision function for novelty detection: classifying new data as similar or different to the training set.
